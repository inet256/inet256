# DNS256

DNS256 is a protocol for DNS over INET256.
Since INET256 provides authenticated communication, a chain of trust can be established from a set of root addresses, to some name to be resolved.

## Paths
DNS uses little-endian names separated by dots e.g. `www.google.com`.
Little-endian just means the least important part (the www) is first and the most important part (the com) is last.
Paths in dns256 are always represented as big-endian lists and they are transmitted on the wire as JSON lists.
The domain name `www.google.com` would be `["com", "google", "www"]`.
This makes it easy to turn into DNS name, or a filesystem path if that's what you want to do.

Each path can have 1 of 2 things associated with it, but not both:
- 0 or more entries.
- A redirect.

Either the server has entries for that path, or it knows of a server which is the authority for that path prefix.

All of the existing DNS record types can be mapped to DNS256 records.
However, DNS256 is more generally a document store for JSON objects at specific paths.
The documents can be queried by their fields.
